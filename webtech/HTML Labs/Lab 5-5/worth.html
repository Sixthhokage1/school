        		It is easy enough to be pleasant,<br />
				When life flows like a song,
			</p>
            <p>
				But the man worth while is one who will smile,<br />
				When everything goes dead wrong.
			</p>
            <p>
				And the smile that is worth the praises of earth,<br />
				Is the smile that shines through tears.
			</p>
            <p>
				It is easy enough to be prudent,<br />
				When nothing temps you to stray.
			</p>
            <p>
				When without or within no voice or sin,<br />
				Is luring your soul away;
			</p>
            <p>
				But it's only a negative virtue<br />
				Until it is tried by fire.
			</p>
            <p>
				And the life that is worth the honor on earth,<br />
				Is the one that resists desire.
			</p>
            <p>
				By the cynic, the sad, the fallen,<br />
				Who had no strength for the strife.
			</p>
            <p>
				The world's highway is cumbered to-day,<br />
				They make up the sum of life.
			</p>
            <p>
				But the virtue that conquers passion,<br />
				And the sorrow that hides in a smile.
			</p>
            <p>
				It is for these that are worth the homage on earth<br />
				For we find them but once in a while.
