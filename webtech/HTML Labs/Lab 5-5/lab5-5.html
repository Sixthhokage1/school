            	When you get what you want in your struggle for self<br />
            	And the world makes you king for a day,<br />
                Just go to the mirror and look at yourself,<br />
                And see what that man has to say.
            </p>
            <p>
            	For it isn't your father or mother or wife,<br />
				Who's judgment upon you must pass;<br />
				The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life<br />
				Is the one staring back from the glass.
			</p>
            <p>
				He's the fellow to please, never mind all the rest.<br />
				For he's with you clear up to the end,<br />
				And you've passed the most dangerous, difficult test<br />
				If the man in the glass is your friend.
			</p>
            <p>
				You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years.<br />
				And get pats on the back as you pass,<br />
				But your final reward will be the heartaches and tears<br />
				If you've cheated the name in the glass.
