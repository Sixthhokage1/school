        		When things go wrong, as they sometimes will,<br />
				When the road you are trudging seems all uphill,<br />
				When the funds are low and the debts are high,<br />
				And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,<br />
				When care is pressing you down a bit,<br />
				Rest, if you must, but don't quit!
			</p>
            <p>
				Live is queer with its twists and turns,<br />
				As every one of us sometimes learns,<br />
				And many a failure turns about,<br />
				When he might have won had he stuck it out;<br />
				Don't give up, though the pace seems slow,<br />
				You might succeed with another blow.
			</p>
            <p>
				Success is failure turned inside out,<br />
				The silver tint of clouds of the doubt,<br />
				And you can never tell how close you are,<br />
				It may be near when it seems so afar;<br />
				So stick to the fight when you are hardest hit,<br />
				It's when things get worse that you mustn't quit!
