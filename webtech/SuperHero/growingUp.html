<body bgcolor="#39b5fd">
I lived the first few years of my life in De Leon, Texas. My mom and my dad broke up when I was about 4, and my mom and I moved to Euless when I was in first grade. In 2004, we moved to a subdivision outside of Keller and we've lived there ever since, with my stepdad since 2006, my little brother since 2007, and my little sister since 2009. I grew up a gamer, and that is the main thing that connects my friends and I.
